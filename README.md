# Open Weather iOS

My personal weather app project using swift and Open Weather API.

ğŸ‘‰ğŸ‘‰ğŸ‘‰ Please pull the project and open the file named "Weather App.xcworkspace". No gitignore file and all the pods are already included in the project for ease of building and testing. ğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆğŸ‘ˆ

This project was written using MVVM architecture without extending the architecture too much.
